# pyLockyDGA
Python Implementation of the Locky DGA Generation algorithm as reversed by the team at Forcepoint.

See this blog post for their article: https://blogs.forcepoint.com/security-labs/lockys-new-dga-seeding-new-domains

Engineered in Python so we can build tools around confirming if domains were Locky related and to predict back in the past, future or present based on current, past or future seed values.

Example run on 1st March:
